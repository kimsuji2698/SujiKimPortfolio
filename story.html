            <h3>Who I am</h3>
        </header>
        <p>My parents are both police officers, so I’ve seen much of what their lives are really like. My mom, a detective in the violent crimes unit, often had to be on stakeout all week and sometimes wouldn’t come home for days. Even after coming home, she’d have trouble sleeping because scenes of horrific murders kept replaying in her mind, and I saw her struggling to fall asleep with the help of sleeping pills more times than I can count. My dad works in a special unit of the riot police, so whenever there’s an emergency, he has to drop everything and head out, even in the middle of the night. He’s faced violent situations at large protests and rallies, and made sure drunk or unruly people could get home safely.</p>

        <p>It’s meaningful work, but it’s definitely a tough life. I  really respect my parents because even after doing such hard work for over 30 years, they’ve never lost their drive to help people. What’s even more amazing is that they haven’t lost their smile or hope in others. Wanting to help even more people, my mom would come home after her shifts and spend dozens of hours completing training, earning certifications one by one, including as a specialist in sexual and domestic violence counseling. She says she wants to make sure victims aren’t retraumatized during investigations and to actually help them through better procedures. My dad is similar. He became a college student in counseling psychology this year to better understand people in violent conflict situations and make wiser decisions, aiming to help more people effectively.</p>

        <p>I’m going to bring the lessons I’ve learned from my parents with me to your institution, especially the part about never giving up, no matter how hard things get. I know the field I’ve chosen isn’t easy. It might take 10 years, or even more to contribute to this field meaningfully as a researcher. But I will never give up. If I can collaborate with other researchers and make even a small contribution to helping someone, that would make me content.</p>

<p>But every time I felt worn out, I thought of my parents and found strength. They went through even tougher things for their children, me and my sister. I know well that the reason they chose stable jobs, even though risky, was because of us. My dad wanted to be a singer, but as the youngest of six children in a family of petty farmers, he couldn’t even afford a guitar. My mom loved books and wanted to be a scholar, but as the daughter of a poor fisherman from a backwater island, she had to study from discarded workbooks just to get into college and even then, she had to drop out.</p>

<p>They always said they didn’t want us to go through the same hardships they did. So they always did their best. Thanks to their efforts, I got countless opportunities to experience and learn from the world to the fullest.</p>

<p>I’m so grateful, and I want to be like them. I especially want to be like their big heart, caring not just for our family, but for others too. The way they’ve spent hours in freezing winter forests searching for missing people with disabilities, helped North Korean defectors have warm holidays by delivering kimchi or essential goods, stopped single moms and dads from attempting extreme acts and gave them courage to keep living, and put others’ safety before their own to evacuate people during disasters. I want to live a life as meaningful as my parents.</p>
<p>So our family motto is simple: “Help others in need—Contribute.” I want to live by that motto too. And for me, the medium is bioinformatics. I want to live a life where I can help improve human health by transforming complex biological data into meaningful insight through research.</p>

<p>As a last note, there’s also a personal reason I chose this path. I had hernia surgery when I was five, and in elementary school I struggled with asthma, carrying a nebulizer with me. Of course, today I am perfectly healthy, but I still have the surgery scars, and clearly remember the days I couldn’t finish running in gym class, and my parents’ worried faces, even more anxious than I was.</p>
<p>I will never forget why I chose this path. And I will always remember who I want to help through my research.</p>
